# NONSENSE
 
A work in progress VR prototype/game made in Unity with the use of SteamVR (mostly to ease up input handling).
At some point this might end up becoming a SUPERHOT/F.E.A.R. styled game with light roguelike elements. Who knows.

# Supported headsets

- All Oculus devices (Quest might require a Link cable, but I am not 100% sure)
- Valve Index
- HTC Vive
- Windows Mixed Reality

SteamVR is required in order for this to work.

# Current content/features

- 2 weapons: a handgun/smg combo that activates if you hold the gun sideways and a lever action shotgun. All guns currently have infinite ammo
- 2 abilities (shards) that you have to attach to the wrist of your left hand: Teleportation (point with your left hand whilst holding grip and press trigger to teleport) and Grenade (hold left hand against yourself whilst holding grip and press trigger to prime grenade, then you can throw it)
- A WIP hub area
